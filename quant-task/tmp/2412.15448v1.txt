                                                      This study evaluates the performance of random forest regression models enhanced with
                                                      technical indicators for high-frequency stock price prediction. Using minute-level SPY
                                                      data, we assessed 13 models that incorporate technical indicators such as Bollinger
                                                      bands, exponential moving average, and Fibonacci retracement. While these models
                                                      improved risk-adjusted performance metrics, they struggled with out-of-sample gener-
                                                      alization, highlighting significant overfitting challenges. Feature importance analysis
                                                      revealed that primary price-based features consistently outperformed technical indica-
                                                      tors, suggesting their limited utility in high-frequency trading contexts. These findings
                                                      challenge the weak form of the efficient market hypothesis, identifying short-lived inef-
                                                      ficiencies during volatile periods but its limited persistence across market regimes. The
                                                      study emphasizes the need for selective feature engineering, adaptive modeling, and
                                                      a stronger focus on risk-adjusted performance metrics to navigate the complexities of
                                                      high-frequency trading environments.

                                            1        Introduction
                                            Accurate stock market prediction remains one of finance’s most challenging pursuits due to the
                                            volatility, noise, and stochastic nature of financial markets. The rapid adoption of high-frequency
                                            trading (HFT), where investment decisions are executed within milliseconds, has further amplified
                                            the demand for robust, real-time predictive models capable of withstanding market fluctuations and
                                            structural complexities [Aldridge, 2013]. These models must not only adapt swiftly to changing mar-
                                            ket conditions but also address the inherent noise and inefficiencies that dominate high-frequency
                                            data [Gu et al., 2020].

                                                                                                 1
    Machine learning (ML) has emerged as a promising approach for stock price prediction, iden-
tifying nonlinear and complex patterns within historical data. Methods such as random forest,
support vector regression (SVR), and gradient boosting have been widely employed in financial
applications due to their robustness and predictive accuracy. However, their performance heavily
depends on the relevance and quality of input features, particularly when they are applied to high-
frequency environments [Derbentsev et al., 2020]. Traditional linear models, including ARIMA and
GARCH, often struggle to capture the intricate dynamics of high-frequency price movements, and,
are, therefore, less suitable for such tasks [Fama, 1970].
    Technical analysis, a longstanding approach in financial trading, involves leveraging historical
price and volume data through technical indicators such as Bollinger bands, exponential moving
averages (EMAs), and the Commodity Channel Index (CCI) to detect trends, identify overbought
or oversold conditions, and signal potential price reversals [Murphy, 1999]. While they are effective
in some scenarios, these technical indicators often generate false signals in HFT environments,
where market noise and volatility dominate price movements [Abrol et al., 2016]. The integration
of technical indicators with machine learning models has been proposed to address these limitations,
as seen in studies by Zanc et al. [2019] and Fischer and Krauss [2018], which demonstrated improved
predictive power through such combinations. However, much of this research focuses on daily
or hourly data, leaving the challenges of minute-level, high-frequency data relatively unexplored
[Zhang, 2010].
    Evaluating financial ML models often involves traditional metrics such as the root mean squared
error (RMSE) and R-squared value. While useful, these metrics fail to capture the asymmetric risks
and rewards inherent in HFT. Advanced risk-reward metrics, including the Rachev ratio, gains-
loss ratio, and modified Rachev ratio, provide a more comprehensive evaluation by focusing on
downside protection and resilience to extreme events [Cheridito and Kromer, 2013]. Such metrics
are particularly valuable in HFT, where volatility magnifies the risk of rapid capital loss, and the
ability to manage tail risks becomes critical.
    In this study, we assess the predictive and risk management performance of random forest
regression models augmented with technical indicators such as Bollinger bands, the EMA, and
the CCI for high-frequency stock price prediction. Unlike many existing studies, our analysis
incorporates minute-level data and emphasizes not only the predictive accuracy but also the risk-
adjusted performance through advanced metrics like the Rachev and gains-loss ratios. Additionally,
we investigate the generalization capabilities of these models and their alignment with the efficient
market hypothesis (EMH). By analyzing both the in-sample and out-of-sample performance, we
highlight the challenges of overfitting, the diminishing utility of certain technical indicators in
high-frequency contexts, and the role of hybrid strategies in managing risk during volatile periods.
    Our findings reveal that while indicator-augmented models demonstrate superior risk-adjusted
metrics, they often underperform in return generation compared to a simple buy-and-hold strategy.
The results challenge the weak form of the EMH, suggesting exploitable inefficiencies during volatile
market conditions but limited sustainability across broader regimes. By bridging technical analysis,
machine learning, and advanced risk management metrics, this research offers actionable insights for
practitioners and academics aiming to refine stock price prediction and risk management strategies
in high-frequency trading environments.


2    Literature Review
Predicting stock prices has long been a challenging task in financial markets due to their inherent
volatility and complexity. Traditional approaches, such as the EMH, suggest that markets are


                                                 2
largely unpredictable, with prices fully reflecting all available information at any given time [Fama,
1970]. However, with advancements in ML and the availability of HFT data, researchers have
increasingly questioned the limits of the EMH and sought to uncover latent patterns in stock
price movements that might be exploitable for short-term forecasting [Gu et al., 2020]. Traditional
methods, while useful, often fail to capture the intricate dynamics of financial markets, necessitating
the integration of diverse approaches, such as technical and fundamental analysis, with advanced
machine learning models. For instance, combining random forest, LSTM, and sentiment analysis
has been shown to create multi-factor models with a superior prediction accuracy [Deep, 2023].

2.1   Machine Learning in Financial Markets
Machine learning techniques have gained significant traction in financial forecasting, offering al-
gorithms capable of identifying nonlinear relationships and patterns in historical data. Random
forest and other ensemble methods, for instance, have demonstrated robustness in handling high-
dimensional data and mitigating overfitting through bagging [Ho, 1995]. Random forest models
have consistently outperformed traditional linear models like ARIMA and GARCH, which often
struggle with nonstationary time series and volatility clustering [Patel et al., 2015, Zhang et al.,
1998].
    Despite their strengths, the performance of ML models is heavily influenced by the relevance
and quality of the input features. Recent studies emphasize the importance of domain-specific
knowledge, such as technical indicators, in improving the predictive performance of ML models
[Agrawal et al., 2019, Lim and Zohren, 2021]. However, these enhancements often come with
challenges, including overfitting and limited generalizability, particularly in high-frequency contexts.

2.2   Role of Technical Indicators in Stock Price Prediction
Technical indicators are widely used by traders and researchers to gauge momentum, identify trends,
and signal potential market reversals. Bollinger bands (BBs), for example, delineate dynamic price
ranges, helping to identify overbought or oversold conditions [Bollinger, 2002]. Studies such as Zanc
et al. [2019] demonstrate that combining BBs with ML models like LSTM networks can reduce noise
in high-frequency stock data, thereby improving the accuracy of price predictions.
    Other technical indicators, such as the CCI and EMA, are frequently used to capture short-
term price movements [Dash and Dash, 2016]. For instance, the EMA’s sensitivity to recent prices
makes it well-suited for models aiming to capture rapid sentiment shifts [Murphy, 1999], while the
CCI’s ability to highlight extreme market movements provides early warnings of trend reversals
[Lambert, 1983].
    Despite their popularity, standalone technical indicators often yield inconsistent results, par-
ticularly in noisy, volatile environments like HFT [Zhang, 2010]. Recent work has shifted toward
integrating these technical indicators into machine learning models to extract meaningful insights
while mitigating market noise. For instance, Fischer and Krauss [2018] demonstrated that com-
bining technical indicators with LSTM networks significantly improved the predictive accuracy.
However, they also noted that the performance gains were highly dependent on the choice of tech-
nical indicators, emphasizing the need for careful feature selection and validation.

2.3   High-Frequency Data and Market Predictability
High-frequency trading data introduce unique challenges, including heightened noise levels and
rapidly changing market conditions. Studies such as Kearns and Nevmyvaka [2013] have shown
that machine learning models can uncover valuable predictive signals in high-frequency data, but

                                                   3
their effectiveness often diminishes due to the short-lived nature of such signals. These challenges
underscore the importance of risk management alongside predictive accuracy [Gu et al., 2020].
    Traditional evaluation metrics, such as the Sharpe and Sortino ratios, provide limited insights
into the performance of ML models in volatile environments due to their reliance on assumptions of
normal return distributions [Aumann and Serrano, 2008]. Advanced risk-reward metrics, including
the Rachev ratio and modified Rachev ratio, offer a more nuanced framework by focusing on
tail risk management and downside protection [Cheridito and Kromer, 2013]. Such metrics are
particularly critical in HFT, where even small inefficiencies can result in significant losses or gains
within milliseconds.

2.4   Gaps in the Literature
While substantial progress has been made in integrating technical indicators and machine learning
for stock prediction, several gaps persist:

  1. Focus on Lower-Frequency Data: Much of the existing literature emphasizes daily or hourly
     data, leaving minute-level, high-frequency data underexplored [Zhang, 2010]. High-frequency
     trading introduces additional complexities, such as increased noise and fleeting arbitrage
     opportunities, which necessitate specialized modeling approaches.

  2. Limited Evaluation of Risk-Reward Performance: Although advanced risk-reward metrics like
     the modified Rachev ratio and gains-loss ratio have been proposed, their application in high-
     frequency contexts remains limited. Evaluating these metrics is crucial for understanding the
     real-world viability of predictive models [Artzner et al., 1999, Fischer and Krauss, 2018].

  3. Effectiveness of Hybrid Models: While hybrid strategies combining multiple technical in-
     dicators have shown promise, their incremental benefits over simpler models are not well-
     documented. Moreover, the interplay between various technical indicators and their contri-
     bution to the overall model performance remains insufficiently explored [Lo et al., 2000].

  4. Generalization Challenges: Overfitting remains a persistent issue, particularly in HFT, where
     models are prone to learning spurious patterns in the data. Few studies explicitly address
     this limitation or propose systematic solutions.

2.5   Contributions of This Study
This study addresses these gaps by systematically evaluating the predictive and risk-adjusted per-
formance of random forest regression models combined with technical indicators in an HFT context.
By incorporating advanced risk-reward metrics, such as the Rachev and gains-loss ratios, this work
provides a more nuanced understanding of model performance under volatile conditions. The anal-
ysis highlights the challenges of generalization and overfitting, demonstrating the limited utility of
technical indicators in high-frequency settings and the importance of primary price-based features.
    Additionally, this study contributes to the ongoing debate on market efficiency by identifying
patterns exploitable during volatile periods, challenging the weak form of the EMH. By bridging
technical analysis, machine learning, and risk management, the findings offer actionable insights
for both practitioners and researchers aiming to refine predictive modeling in financial markets.

3     Methodology
In this section, we describe the data acquisition process, technical indicator computation, machine
learning model (random forest regressor), and trading simulation framework. The decisions made
in each step are guided by the need to rigorously assess the impact of technical indicators on stock
price prediction using random forest.

3.1     Data Acquisition and Preprocessing
The dataset used in this study consists of minute-level historical stock data for the SPY (S&P
500 ETF), covering the period from April 2024 to September 2024. These data include essential
fields such as the open, high, low, and close prices, as well as the trading volume for each minute.
The data were obtained from the Bloomberg Terminal, ensuring high accuracy and reliability
[Bloomberg L.P., 2024]. Each data point is timestamped in Central Time (CT), and the dataset
covers the typical US stock market hours from 9:30 AM to 4:00 PM Eastern Time (ET), adjusted
for daylight savings time.
    Additionally, the 10-year US Treasury yield is incorporated as a proxy for the risk-free rate, a
crucial factor in calculating excess returns. These data are reported daily and were also sourced from
the Bloomberg Terminal, spanning the same time frame as the SPY data [Pastor and Stambaugh,
2003].

3.1.1    Log Returns and Volatility Calculation
To normalize the stock price data and reduce the effects of scale, we compute log returns for the
open, high, low, and close prices. Log returns are preferred in financial time series due to their
ability to capture percentage changes and handle volatility over time [Box et al., 2015]. The log
return for a price series Pt is calculated as
                                                                 
                                                              Pt
                                     log return(Pt ) = log          ,                          (1)
                                                             Pt−1
    where Pt is the price at time t and Pt−1 is the price at the previous time step. This process is
applied to the open, high, low, and close prices, with the resulting log returns stored as additional
columns in the dataset. Additionally, we compute rolling z-scores for the trading volume to capture
volume anomalies. The rolling z-score of the volume is given by [Box et al., 2015]

                                       volumet − mean(volume)
                                volz(t) =                      ,                            (2)
                                             std(volume)
    where the mean and standard deviation are computed over a rolling window of 60 minutes.

3.1.2    Risk-Free Rate and Excess Returns
The 10-year US Treasury yield, provided on a daily basis, is used to compute a per-minute risk-free
rate, which is necessary for calculating excess returns. The transformation from the daily yield to
a per-minute rate is given by
                                                              1
                                  rper-minute = (1 + rdaily ) 1440 − 1,                           (3)
    where 1440 is the number of minutes in a day. The risk-free rate is subtracted from the stock’s
log returns to compute excess returns, which form the basis for evaluating risk-adjusted performance
measures like the Sharpe and Sortino ratios [Alexander and Baptista, 2003].

                                                   5
3.1.3    Data Filtering and Splitting
The dataset is filtered to focus on regular market trading hours, between 10:00 AM and 3:30 PM
CT, to avoid periods of low liquidity, such as pre-market and after-hours trading [McGroarty et
al., 2019]. The filtered dataset is then split into training and testing sets, with 80% of the data
allocated to training and 20% to testing. The splitting is time-ordered to preserve the temporal
nature of stock price data and avoid data leakage.
     The processed dataset is used for computing a set of technical indicators, which serve as input
features for the machine learning models described in subsequent sections. The computed technical
indicators include the simple moving average (SMA), EMA, moving average convergence divergence
(MACD), Relative Strength Index (RSI), and others, as detailed below.

3.2     Technical Indicators
To capture diverse aspects of market behavior, we selected a set of widely recognized technical
indicators, each chosen for its unique contribution to predicting price movements or managing risk.
These technical indicators encompass a variety of trend-following, momentum, and volume-based
metrics, enabling a robust, multi-faceted analysis of minute-level price movements.
    For instance, the EMA and MACD offer insights into trend strength and direction, while BBs
and the RSI gauge volatility and overbought/oversold conditions, respectively [Murphy, 1999]. The
average directional index (ADX) measures trend robustness, the on-balance volume (OBV) tracks
volume flow, and the CCI detects cyclical price movements [Lambert, 1983]. By combining these
technical indicators, we aimed to create a feature set capable of reflecting both short-term and
long-term market dynamics, thus enhancing the predictive accuracy and enabling nuanced risk
management [Zanc et al., 2019].

3.2.1    Simple Moving Average (SMA)
The SMA smooths price data by averaging the closing prices over a window of N periods:
                                                      N −1
                                                1 X
                                     SMAN (t) =     Ct−i ,                                       (4)
                                                N
                                                       i=0

   where Ct represents the closing price at time t. In our implementation, the current price is
normalized by the SMA:

                                       ˆ N (t) =       Ct
                                      SMA                     .                                  (5)
                                                     SMAN (t)
   This ensures scale invariance and helps the model better learn from price data.

3.2.2    Exponential Moving Average (EMA)
The EMA places more weight on recent prices, making it more responsive to price changes. It is
calculated recursively as follows:

                                 EMAt = αCt + (1 − α)EMAt−1 ,                                    (6)
    where α = N 2+1 is the smoothing factor for a window size N . In our implementation, the EMA
is normalized similarly to the SMA:



                                                 6
                                          ˆ t=        Ct
                                         EMA              .                                    (7)
                                                     EMAt
   This ratio stabilizes the feature and makes it more useful for predictive modeling.

3.2.3   Moving Average Convergence Divergence (MACD)
The MACD measures the difference between short-term and long-term EMAs. It is computed as
follows:

                              MACDt = EMA12 (Ct ) − EMA26 (Ct ).                               (8)
   The signal line SIGt is a 9-period EMA of the MACD line. We use the following ratio to
normalize the MACD:

                                               MACDt − SIGt
                                rMACD =                            .                           (9)
                                          0.5 (|MACDt | + |SIGt |)
   This ensures that large fluctuations in the MACD do not overwhelm the model.

3.2.4   Relative Strength Index (RSI)
The RSI is a momentum oscillator that measures the speed and change of price movements [Wilder,
1978]. It is computed as follows:
                                                         100
                                   RSIt = 100 −                      ,                       (10)
                                                     1 + avg gaint
                                                         avg losst

   where avg gaint and avg losst are exponentially smoothed averages of gains and losses over a
window of 14 periods. RSI values range from 0 to 100, identifying potential overbought or oversold
conditions.

3.2.5   Bollinger Bands (BBs)
Bollinger bands are volatility bands placed two standard deviations above and below a moving
average. They are defined as follows:

                       UBBt = SMAN (t) + 2σt ,       LBBt = SMAN (t) − 2σt ,                 (11)
   where σt is the standard deviation of prices over the last N periods [Bollinger, 2002]. The
normalized BB percentage is

                                               Ct − LBBt
                                     BB%t =               .                                  (12)
                                              UBBt − LBBt
   This captures where the price sits within the volatility bands.

3.2.6    Stochastic Oscillator (SO)
The stochastic oscillator (SO) measures the relative position of the closing price compared to the
high-low range over a specified period (typically 14 periods). It is computed as follows:

                                                   Ct − L14 (t)
                                  %Kt = 100 ×                       ,                          (13)
                                                  H14 (t) − L14 (t)
    where L14 (t) and H14 (t) represent the lowest and highest prices over the last 14 periods. The
slow stochastic oscillator %Dt is a 3-period moving average of %Kt .

3.2.7    Fibonacci Retracement (Fib)
Fibonacci retracement levels are used to identify potential support and resistance levels in a price
trend. For a window N , the retracement level R(t) is computed as follows:

                                                HN (t) − Ct
                                      R(t) =                   ,                               (14)
                                               HN (t) − LN (t)
   where HN (t) and LN (t) are the highest and lowest prices over the window, respectively. We use
common Fibonacci levels (0.236, 0.382, 0.500, 0.618, 0.764) to identify potential reversal points.

3.2.8    Average Directional Index (ADX)
The ADX measures the strength of a trend, regardless of its direction. The ADX is derived from
the directional movement indicators DIt+ and DIt− :

                                                |DIt+ − DIt− |
                                      ADXt =                   .                               (15)
                                                 DIt+ + DIt−
   The directional movement indicators DIt+ and DIt− are normalized by the average true range
(ATR).

3.2.9    On-Balance Volume (OBV)
The OBV is a cumulative indicator that sums the volume depending on whether the price is rising
or falling. It is computed as follows:

                              OBVt = OBVt−1 + sgn(Ct − Ct−1 )Vt ,                              (16)
   where Vt is the trading volume at time t, and the signum function determines the direction of
the volume flow.

3.2.10    Windowed Relative OBV (WROBV)
The windowed relative OBV (WROBV) is a modified version of the OBV, where the cumulative
OBV is computed over a rolling window of size N to smooth out the indicator:
                                                  PN −1
                                                      i=0 OBVt−i
                                   WROBVt =           P N −1
                                                                 .                             (17)
                                                        i=0 Vt−i
    This rolling normalization prevents the OBV from growing excessively large and focuses on
recent price-volume dynamics.


                                                  8
3.2.11    Commodity Channel Index (CCI)
The CCI measures the deviation of the typical price from its moving average:

                                                    Ht + Lt + Ct
                                             pt =                .                                      (18)
                                                         3
   The CCI is given by

                                                    pt − SMAN (pt )
                                         CCIt =                     ,                                   (19)
                                                    0.015 × MADt
   where MADt is the mean absolute deviation of pt over a rolling window of size N .

3.2.12    Ichimoku Cloud (Ichimoku)
The Ichimoku Cloud is a comprehensive technical indicator that provides a holistic view of support,
resistance, the trend direction, and momentum [Patel, 2010]. It consists of five main components:

   • Tenkan-sen (Conversion Line): This line is a short-term indicator calculated as the midpoint
     of the highest high and the lowest low over the past N periods:

                                         max(Ht−N , . . . , Ht ) + min(Lt−N , . . . , Lt )
                           Tenkant =                                                       ,            (20)
                                                                 2
     where Ht and Lt represent the high and low prices at time t, respectively. Typically, N = 9.

   • Kijun-sen (Base Line): The base line is a longer-term indicator calculated similarly to the
     Tenkan-sen but over a longer window M :

                                        max(Ht−M , . . . , Ht ) + min(Lt−M , . . . , Lt )
                            Kijunt =                                                      .             (21)
                                                                2
     This line provides a measure of medium-term momentum, with M = 26 being a common
     value.

   • Senkou Span A (Leading Span A): Senkou Span A is the midpoint between the Tenkan-sen
     and Kijun-sen, plotted M periods ahead:

                                    Tenkant + Kijunt
                   Senkou At =                               (shifted forward by M periods).            (22)
                                           2
     This span, along with Senkou Span B, forms the Ichimoku Cloud.

   • Senkou Span B (Leading Span B): This span is the midpoint of the highest high and lowest
     low over the past L periods and is also plotted M periods ahead:


                       max(Ht−L , . . . , Ht ) + min(Lt−L , . . . , Lt )
         Senkou Bt =                                                       (shifted forward by M periods).
                                               2
                                                                                                        (23)
     The area between Senkou Span A and Senkou Span B is shaded to form the ”cloud,” which
     can act as dynamic support or resistance.


                                                        9
   • Chikou Span (Lagging Span): The Chikou Span is the current closing price plotted M periods
     in the past:

                            Chikout = Ct    (shifted backward by M periods).                    (24)
      This line provides a lagging indication of price action and helps confirm the trend direction.
The Ichimoku Cloud provides a visual representation of support and resistance, the trend direction,
and momentum. The interaction between the price and the cloud helps identify potential reversals
or continuations in the trend. In our implementation, we calculate all five components of the
Ichimoku system and incorporate the leading spans (Senkou A and Senkou B) as features in the
machine learning model.

3.3   Random Forest Regressor (RFR)
For the machine learning model, we use a random forest regressor (RFR) to predict future stock
price movements. The RFR is an ensemble learning method that fits multiple decision trees on
random subsets of the data and aggregates their predictions to reduce variance and overfitting [Ho,
1995]. Each tree in the forest is trained on a bootstrapped sample of the data, and the prediction
for a given input is the average of the individual tree predictions.
    Given a feature matrix X (which includes the technical indicators described above) and a target
vector Y (the log returns), the RFR minimizes the mean squared error (MSE) between the predicted
and actual returns:
                                                        B
                                                  1 X
                                        ŷ(x) =       Tb (x),                                   (25)
                                                  B
                                                    b=1
    where Tb (x) is the prediction from the b-th tree in the ensemble, and B is the total number of
trees.
    The model is trained on 80% of the data, and the remaining 20% is used for out-of-sample
testing. To avoid overfitting, hyperparameters such as the number of trees, maximum tree depth,
and minimum samples per leaf are tuned using cross-validation [Derbentsev et al., 2020].

3.4   Trading Simulation Framework
We simulate a trading strategy based on the buy, sell, and hold signals generated by the random
forest model. The trading simulation starts with an initial portfolio value of $10,000. The following
actions are taken based on model predictions:
   • Buy Signal: If the model predicts an upward price movement, a portion of the available
     cash is used to buy shares.
   • Sell Signal: If a downward price movement is predicted, a portion of the holdings is sold.
   • Hold Signal: If no significant price movement is predicted, no action is taken.
   To account for real-world constraints, we impose a turnover constraint of 0.4%, meaning that
no more than 0.4% of the portfolio value can be traded at any given time:

                                       value traded
                                                      ≤ 0.004.                                 (26)
                                      portfolio value
   This simulates liquidity constraints and transaction costs, making the simulation more realistic.

                                                   10
3.5   Evaluation Metrics
We assess the performance of the random forest model using a comprehensive set of metrics that
evaluate both the predictive accuracy and risk-adjusted returns:

   • Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE): It reflects the square root of the average squared
     differences between the predicted and actual returns:
                                              v
                                              u n
                                              u1 X
                                       RMSE = t    (ŷi − yi )2 .                               (27)
                                                n
                                                          i=1

      A lower RMSE indicates a better predictive accuracy.

   • Mean Absolute Error (MAE): It captures the average absolute differences between pre-
     dicted and actual returns, offering an intuitive measure of the model accuracy.

   • R-squared (R²): It measures the proportion of variance in the target variable explained by
     the model:
                                                Pn
                                          2          (yi − ŷi )2
                                        R = 1 − Pi=1
                                                  n             2
                                                                  ,                             (28)
                                                  i=1 (yi − ȳ)

      where ȳ is the mean of the actual returns. A higher R2 value indicates a stronger model
      performance.

   • Trend Accuracy: It evaluates the model’s ability to predict the direction (up or down) of
     price movements:

                                                      n
                                                 1X
                             Trend Accuracy =       1(sign(yi ) = sign(ŷi )),                  (29)
                                                 n
                                                   i=1

      where 1 is an indicator function returning 1 if the predicted direction matches the actual
      direction, and 0 otherwise.

   • Sharpe Ratio: It assesses the risk-adjusted performance of the trading strategy:

                                                            E[rp − rf ]
                                       Sharpe Ratio =                   ,                       (30)
                                                                σp

      where rp is the portfolio return, rf is the risk-free rate, and σp is the standard deviation of
      portfolio returns. A higher Sharpe ratio indicates better risk-adjusted returns.

   • Maximum Drawdown: It represents the largest peak-to-trough decline in the portfolio
     value over the testing period:
                                                                               
                                                              peakt − trought
                              Max Drawdown = max                                    .           (31)
                                                  t∈T              peakt

      This metric is crucial for evaluating the worst-case performance of the trading strategy during
      periods of market stress.

                                                 11
    • Sortino Ratio: It is a variation of the Sharpe ratio that focuses only on downside risk:

                                                          E[rp − rf ]

                                                      Downside Deviation
        where the downside deviation is calculated using only negative returns. This ratio penalizes
        excessive downside risk more than overall volatility.

   These metrics provide a well-rounded evaluation of the RFR’s predictive accuracy and its ability
to manage risk in the context of an HFT strategy.

3.6     Risk-Reward Ratios Selection
In selecting risk-reward ratios for this study, we follow the theoretical framework laid out by Cherid-
ito and Kromer [2013], focusing on ratios that satisfy the following four critical properties:

    • Monotonicity (M): This property ensures that the reward-risk ratio (RRR) increases as
      returns increase, for a fixed level of risk. Essentially, this criterion reflects the intuitive idea
      that ”more is better.” Formally, for two random variables X and Y , where X ≥ Y , a ratio
      ρ(X) ≥ ρ(Y ) should hold.

    • Quasi-concavity (Q): Quasi-concavity encourages diversification, ensuring that the ratio
      prefers averages over extremes. If a reward-risk ratio satisfies this property, this means that a
      diversified portfolio will generally be preferred over concentrated risk. Formally, for random
      variables X and Y , and for any λ ∈ [0, 1], we should have ρ(λX +(1−λ)Y ) ≥ min(ρ(X), ρ(Y )).

    • Scale Invariance (S): Scale invariance means that the ratio remains unchanged when both
      the return and the risk of a portfolio are scaled by the same factor. This property ensures that
      the ratio is consistent across different investment sizes, and it is defined by ρ(λX) = ρ(X) for
      all positive scalars λ.

    • Distribution-based (D): This property ensures that the ratio depends only on the dis-
      tribution of the returns X and not on any specific realization of X. This is essential for
      generalizing the performance metric across different scenarios and portfolio strategies.

    These properties form a robust basis for evaluating performance metrics, ensuring that they
promote diversification and reward consistency. Many risk-reward ratios used in the financial
literature—such as the Sharpe ratio, Sortino ratio, Rachev ratio, and others—naturally satisfy
these criteria. The ratios chosen for this study align with these principles, allowing a comprehensive
evaluation of portfolio performance.

4.3.2    Impact of Technical Indicators
To understand the impact of incorporating technical indicators, we analyzed the feature importance
for the top-performing models with technical indicators. We provide the corresponding plots for
the models with the EMA, RSI, and BBs.
    For the BB model (Figure 3), the close price had an importance of 18.6%, followed by
Bollinger%b with 14.7% and the volume (z-score normalized) with 14.6%.
    For the EMA model (Figure 4), the EMA contributed 18.3%, the close price had an importance
of 17.8%, and the volume accounted for 14.5%.
    For the RSI model (Figure 5), the close price had the highest importance at 18.7%, followed
by the RSI at 15.5% and the volume at 14.4%.
    Analyzing these feature importances, it is evident that the introduction of technical indicators
caused some shifts in the significance of various features. For instance, in all three models, the
inclusion of the respective technical indicators (EMA, RSI, and BBs) slightly reduced the impor-
tance of primary price-based features such as the close, open, and high prices. However, none of
the models showed a marked improvement in the out-of-sample performance, suggesting that the
additional complexity introduced by these indicators did not lead to a substantial enhancement of
the predictive accuracy.

4.4     Risk-Adjusted Performance Analysis
4.4.1    Risk Metrics
The evaluation of risk-adjusted performance metrics showed consistent patterns across models.
The Sharpe ratio ranged from -0.0116 to 0.0046, with the base model performing the best. The
Sortino ratio spanned from -0.0133 to 0.0047, indicating challenges in managing the downside risk.
The Rachev ratio values were between 0.919 and 0.961, reflecting a relatively balanced tail risk
distribution. Additionally, the modified Rachev ratio clustered around 0.050, suggesting similar
risk-reward trade-offs among the models.
    The risk-reward performance across models is depicted using two visualizations: Figure 6 and
Figure 7. The radar chart (Figure 6) illustrates the comparative risk-reward profiles of the top five
models, while the heatmap (Figure 7) provides a detailed comparison of risk-reward ratios for all
models.

4.5     Model Prediction Analysis
4.5.1    Residual Analysis
Residual analysis revealed key aspects of the models’ predictive behavior. The residuals followed an
approximately normal distribution with a mean near zero, indicating no significant bias. The vari-
ance was consistent across the prediction range, confirming homoscedasticity and stable predictive
reliability. Additionally, there was no significant autocorrelation in residual patterns, suggesting
appropriate independence in the predictions.

4.6     Directional Accuracy
The models exhibited varied directional accuracies between the training and testing phases. During
the training period, the directional accuracy ranged from 80.5% to 86.7%, whereas in the testing
phase, the accuracy dropped to between 47.6% and 49.5%. This discrepancy indicates challenges in
generalizing to out-of-sample data. The correlation coefficient was also notably different, ranging
from 0.86 to 0.92 during training but decreasing significantly to between 0.03 and 0.06 during
testing.

4.7     Comparative Analysis
4.7.1    Technical Indicator Contribution
The analysis of technical indicators revealed that incorporating them did not lead to a significant
improvement over the base model. The added complexity from technical indicators did not yield
proportional gains in the predictive accuracy, and the notable performance gap between training
and testing highlighted potential overfitting.

4.7.2    Hybrid Model Performance
Hybrid models that combined multiple technical indicators showed moderate improvement in sta-
bility metrics, including reduced maximum drawdown. However, their final returns were similar to
those of simpler models, suggesting limited incremental benefits.

4.8     Statistical Significance
Statistical tests indicated that, while in-sample R2 values were relatively high (0.749 to 0.812), the
models demonstrated a poor out-of-sample performance, with negative R2 values during testing (-
0.020 to -0.016). The RMSE and MAE remained consistent across models at approximately 0.00036
and 0.00024, respectively, indicating uniformity in prediction errors.
    These results suggest that, despite a strong in-sample performance, the models struggled with
generalization, highlighting the potential limitations of using technical indicators in the given mar-
ket conditions.


5     Discussion
This study assessed the performance of 13 RFR models enhanced with technical indicators for high-
frequency stock price prediction. The findings highlight several key insights into the effectiveness
of these models, the role of technical indicators, and the challenges of generalization in volatile
markets.

5.1     Model Performance and Generalization Challenges
The results revealed a consistent discrepancy between the in-sample and out-of-sample performance
across all models. While training R2 values ranged from 0.749 to 0.812, testing values were nega-
tive for all models, indicating poor generalization. This discrepancy is indicative of overfitting, a
common issue in machine learning applications for financial forecasting, particularly when working
with high-dimensional data and complex features such as technical indicators.
    The underperformance of algorithmic trading strategies compared to the buy-and-hold bench-
mark underscores the difficulty of extracting consistent predictive signals from high-frequency data.

                                                 22
Despite achieving lower maximum drawdowns, the RFR models failed to generate positive returns,
highlighting the limitations imposed by noise inherent in high-frequency stock price movements.

5.2   Effectiveness of Technical Indicators
The inclusion of technical indicators (Ichimoku, EMA, Fibonacci retracement) significantly en-
hanced certain risk-adjusted performance metrics, such as the Rachev and modified Rachev ratios.
However, many indicators, including the RSI and SO, showed inconsistent or minimal impacts,
raising questions about their predictive utility in high-frequency contexts.
    Feature importance analysis revealed that primary price-based features (e.g., close, open, and
high prices) consistently outperformed technical indicators. This aligns with prior studies suggesting
that while technical indicators capture broader market trends, they are less effective for minute-level
data dominated by noise and microstructure effects.
    Hybrid strategies combining multiple indicators (e.g., RSI, EMA, BBs) outperformed simpler
setups, particularly in managing tail risks. These findings underscore the value of combining diverse
features to enhance model robustness, even though the incremental gains in the predictive accuracy
were limited.

5.3   Risk-Adjusted Performance
Despite their underwhelming predictive accuracy, the RFR models demonstrated some strengths
in managing risk. The BB and hybrid RSI-EMA-BB models achieved relatively higher Sharpe and
Rachev ratios, indicating better tail risk management compared to other models. These findings
suggest that while the models may not excel in generating returns, they offer value as tools for
risk-averse strategies, particularly in volatile market conditions.
    The use of advanced risk-reward metrics, such as the Rachev and modified Rachev ratios, pro-
vided deeper insights into the model performance. These metrics highlight the trade-offs between
return generation and risk management, which are crucial in HFT. Hybrid strategies also demon-
strated a superior performance on gains-loss ratios, capturing gains effectively while mitigating
losses during downturns.

5.4   Behavioral and Regime-Specific Insights
The performance of certain technical indicators, such as Ichimoku and the EMA, varied significantly
based on market regimes. These indicators performed well in trending markets but faltered during
sideways price movements, suggesting sensitivity to market conditions. This observation aligns
with behavioral finance theories, where trader heuristics are more effective in certain regimes.
    Conversely, the poor performance of the RSI and SO suggests that classical indicators may not
align with modern trading dynamics, potentially due to the diminishing influence of behavioral
biases in high-frequency contexts.

5.5   Implications for the Efficient Market Hypothesis
The results challenge the weak form of the EMH, which posits that historical price data cannot
be used to predict future price movements. While the RFR models exhibited a strong in-sample
performance, their failure to generalize to unseen data suggests that high-frequency stock price
movements are dominated by noise, making it difficult to exploit short-term inefficiencies for con-
sistent profit.



                                                  23
    However, the ability of some indicator-augmented models to achieve balanced tail risk distri-
butions and manage extreme market movements suggests that partial inefficiencies may exist in
specific risk-reward trade-offs, particularly during periods of heightened volatility. This observation
aligns with the notion that market inefficiencies are more pronounced under extreme conditions,
offering opportunities for risk-averse strategies.

5.6   Overfitting and Model Complexity
The observed overfitting highlights the challenges of developing machine learning models for HFT.
Complex models often achieved a superior backtest performance, but this did not translate to better
out-of-sample results. This underscores the importance of parsimony in financial modeling, where
simpler models may provide better robustness and interpretability.
    Future work should explore adaptive models, such as ensemble methods or deep learning archi-
tectures, that can dynamically adjust to changing market conditions. Additionally, incorporating
more robust feature engineering techniques, such as denoising algorithms or market microstructure
features, may help improve generalization.

5.7   Practical Implications and Interpretability
From a practitioner’s perspective, the findings suggest that machine learning models in HFT
should prioritize risk management over return maximization. The interpretability of models using
Ichimoku or Fibonacci retracement may appeal to practitioners, as these align with intuitive
trading heuristics. Computational simplicity also makes certain RFR models more practical for
real-world deployment, despite their slight underperformance compared to hybrid approaches.

5.8   Limitations
This study has several limitations that warrant consideration. First, the evaluation was limited to
RFRs, which may not fully capture the sequential dependencies inherent in high-frequency data.
Second, the analysis focused solely on technical indicators, excluding other potentially informative
features such as sentiment data or order book dynamics. Third, the relatively short evaluation
period may not fully reflect the models’ performance under varying market conditions.

5.9   Summary
In summary, this study highlights the challenges and opportunities of applying machine learning
models in HFT. While the RFR models struggled with generalization and return generation, their
strengths in risk management and stability metrics provide valuable insights for risk-averse trading
strategies. The nuanced performance of technical indicators underscores the need for selective
feature engineering and regime-specific modeling. Future research should aim to refine feature
selection, mitigate overfitting, and explore hybrid approaches to enhance the utility of machine
learning in financial forecasting.


6     Conclusion
This study evaluated the integration of technical indicators into random forest regressor (RFR)
models for high-frequency stock price prediction, focusing on both the predictive accuracy and
risk-adjusted performance. Using minute-level SPY data, we analyzed the effectiveness of vari-
ous technical indicators, including Bollinger bands, the exponential moving average (EMA), and

                                                  24
Fibonacci retracement, and assessed their contributions to the model performance under volatile
market conditions.
     The results reveal that while technical indicators improved certain risk-adjusted metrics, such as
the Rachev and gains-loss ratios, their impact on the out-of-sample predictive accuracy was limited.
Feature importance analysis consistently demonstrated that primary price-based features, such as
the close, open, and high prices, were more significant contributors to the model performance
than technical indicators. Hybrid strategies, combining multiple indicators, exhibited marginal
improvements in managing tail risks but failed to outperform the buy-and-hold benchmark in
return generation.
     Despite these limitations, the study highlights the value of machine learning models in managing
risk during volatile market periods. Advanced risk-reward metrics, such as the Rachev ratio and
modified Rachev ratio, provided deeper insights into the model performance, emphasizing the trade-
off between risk management and return generation. These findings challenge the weak form of the
efficient market hypothesis (EMH), suggesting the existence of short-lived inefficiencies that may
be exploitable under specific conditions.
     The study also underscores significant challenges, including overfitting and generalization issues,
which remain critical barriers to the practical application of machine learning in high-frequency
trading. Complex models often performed well in training but failed to generalize to unseen data,
highlighting the need for more robust feature engineering and adaptive modeling techniques.
     From a practitioner’s perspective, this research emphasizes the importance of balancing com-
putational simplicity, interpretability, and predictive power. While RFR models may not excel in
return generation, their ability to manage tail risks and provide interpretable outputs makes them
valuable tools for risk-averse strategies. Moreover, the interpretability of certain technical indica-
tors, such as Fibonacci retracement and the Ichimoku Cloud, may align well with intuitive trading
heuristics, enhancing their practical appeal.
     In conclusion, this study contributes to the ongoing discourse on the role of machine learning
and technical analysis in financial markets by providing a nuanced understanding of their strengths
and limitations. The findings highlight the need for selective feature engineering, regime-specific
modeling, and a greater emphasis on risk management in high-frequency trading environments.
Future research should focus on developing adaptive, hybrid approaches that address generalization
challenges and incorporate alternative data sources to improve the predictive accuracy and practical
utility.


7    Future Work
This study highlights several opportunities for further exploration. First, extending the analysis
to diverse asset classes, such as commodities and cryptocurrencies, can provide insights into the
adaptability of technical indicators across markets. Second, incorporating additional data sources,
such as order book dynamics and sentiment analysis, may enhance the predictive accuracy and risk
assessment.
    Third, exploring deep learning architectures, including LSTM and Transformer models, could
better capture sequential dependencies in high-frequency data. Comparisons with other algorithms,
such as gradient boosting machines or hybrid ensembles, may also reveal superior modeling ap-
proaches.
    Finally, developing adaptive frameworks capable of responding to evolving market regimes and
integrating real-world constraints, such as transaction costs, will improve the practicality of these
models for deployment in high-frequency trading environments.
